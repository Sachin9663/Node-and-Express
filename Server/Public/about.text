People tend to think that "About Us" pages have to sound formal to
         gain credibility and trust. But most people find it easier to trust real human beings,
          rather than a description that sounds like it came from an automaton. 
          Trying to sound too professional on your "About Us" page results in stiff, “safe” 
          copy and design --  
        the perfect way to make sure your company blends in with the masses.
